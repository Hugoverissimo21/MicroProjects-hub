# MicroProjects-hub

**A collection of small-scale projects, experiments, and reports showcasing diverse skills and concepts.**

## DataCamp Projects

- Language: English

- Tools: Python, R, SQL

1) [Cleaning Bank Marketing Campaign Data](https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/MicroProjects-hub/Cleaning%20Bank%20Marketing%20Campaign%20Data/notebook.html)
  
    -   Used Python (pandas) for data manipulation and transformation.
    -   Employed various methods such as str.replace, map, and apply for column value transformations.
    -   Exported transformed DataFrames to CSV files for further use.

2) [Building Financial Reports](https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/MicroProjects-hub/Building%20Financial%20Reports/notebook.html)
  
    -   Utilized Python with pandas and seaborn to analyze financial data from XLSX files.
    -   Calculated key financial ratios (leverage ratio and profitability ratio).
    -   Explored the relationship between leverage and profitability for a specific company type ("real_est") through a scatter plot, finding a positive correlation.

3) [Modeling Car Insurance Claim Outcomes](https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/MicroProjects-hub/Modeling%20Car%20Insurance%20Claim%20Outcomes/notebook.html)
  
    -   Utilized R with readr and dplyr to manipulate data from a CSV file.
    -   Created logistic regression models for each column in the dataset, calculating the accuracy of each model in predicting the 'outcome' variable.
    -   Identified the most accurate model by employing DataFrame transformations.

4) [Analyze International Debt Statistics](https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/MicroProjects-hub/Analyze%20International%20Debt%20Statistics/notebook.html)

    -   Used SQL to obtain the total count of unique countries in the "international_debt" dataset, providing an overview of the dataset's geographical diversity.
    -   Extracted a list of unique debt indicators from the dataset, offering a concise summary of the different financial metrics considered.
    -   Calculated the overall sum of debt across the dataset, presenting the total debt in a more readable format in millions.

5) [Analyzing TV Data](https://github.com/Hugoverissimo21/MicroProjects-hub/tree/main/Analyzing%20TV%20Data) - DataCamp Project

    - Data cleaning and DataFrame manipulation
    - Assumption verification (normality, homogeneity, etc.)
    - Descriptive data analysis
    - Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
    - Linear regression: estimation, optimization and analysis

3) [Study of Time Series (Decomposition Fitting and Forecasting)](https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/MicroProjects-hub/Study%20of%20Time%20Series%20(Decomposition%20Fitting%20and%20Forecasting)/Tarefas.pdf) [R, for Modeling and Forecasting Time Series]

    - Graphical analysis of time series (trend and seasonality)
    - Classical decomposition, Loess decomposition, ETS, and ARIMA models
    - Forecasting using various methods (naive, drift, seasonal naive, etc.)
    - Error measurements and residual diagnostics
