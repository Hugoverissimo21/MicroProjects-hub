The Head of Data at On the Road car insurance has asked for your support as they venture into the world of machine learning! They would like you to start by investigating their customer data and cleaning it in preparation for modeling. Once that is complete, they would like you to tell them which feature produces the best accuracy for predicting whether a customer will make a car insurance claim. Specifically, they have set the following tasks:

- Investigate and clean the data, so that there are no missing values and remove the `"id"` column.

- Find the feature with the best predictive performance for a car insurance claim (`"outcome"`) by creating simple Logistic Regression models (each with a single feature) and assessing their accuracy.

- Create a data frame called `best_feature_df`, containing columns named `"best_feature"` and `"best_accuracy"` with the name of the feature with the highest accuracy, and the respective accuracy score.
